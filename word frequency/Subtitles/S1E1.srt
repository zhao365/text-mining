00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,969
Desperate Housewives S01E01 Pilot (VO+STFR&EN)

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,379
My name is Mary Alice Young.

3
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:22,444
In this morning's paper,
you may come across an article

4
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,888
about the unusual day I had last wek.

5
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,486
Normally, there's never anything
newsworthy about my life,

6
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:32,395
but that all changed last Thursday.

7
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:36,196
Of course, everything semed
quite normal at first.

8
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,100
I made breakfast for my family.

9
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,301
I performed my chores.

10
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,507
I completed my projects.

11
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,141
I ran my errands.

12
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,448
In truth, I spent the day
as I spent every other day,

13
00:00:54,521 --> 00:01:00,892
quietly polishing the routine of my life
until it gleamed with perfection.

14
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:07,929
That's why it was so astonishing when
I decided to go to my hallway closet

15
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:12,767
and retrieve a revolver
that had never ben used.

16
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:21,671
My body was discovered
by my neighbor, Mrs. Martha Huber,

17
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,149
who'd ben startled
by a strange popping sound.

18
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,378
Her curiosity aroused,

19
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:31,220
Mrs. Huber tried to think of a reason
for dropping in on me unannounced.

20
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,391
After some initial hesitation,

21
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:41,901
she decided to return the blender she
had borrowed from me six months before.

22
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,649
It's my neighbor. I think she's been
shot. There's blood everywhere.

23
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,628
Yes, you've got to send an ambulance.

24
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,598
You've got to send one right now.

25
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:21,671
And, for a moment, Mrs. Huber
stood motionless in her kitchen,

26
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,733
grief-stricken
by this senseless tragedy.

27
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,438
But only for a moment.

28
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,311
If there was one thing
Mrs. Huber was known for,

29
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:34,217
it was her ability
to look on the bright side.

30
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,351
I was laid to rest on a Monday.

31
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,489
After the funeral,
all the residents of Wisteria Lane

32
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,467
came to pay their respects.

33
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:53,766
And, as people do in these situations,
they brought food.

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,400
Lynette Scavo brought fried chicken.

35
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,569
Lynette had a great family recipe
for fried chicken.

36
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,308
She didn't cook much
while moving up the corporate ladder.

37
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,144
She didn't have the time.

38
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:09,780
But when her doctor announced she was
pregnant, her husband Tom had an idea.

39
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,619
"Why not quit yourjob?"

40
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:16,151
"Kids do better with stay-at-home moms.
It would be so much less stressful."

41
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,230
But this was not the case.

42
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,391
In fact, Lynette's life
had become so hectic

43
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:25,597
she was now forced to get her chicken
from the fast-food restaurant.

44
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,402
Lynette would've appreciated the irony
if she'd thought about it.

45
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,534
But she didn't have the time.

46
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,909
- Stop it, stop it, stop it.
- But, Mom.

47
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,141
No. You are going to behave today.

48
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,947
I am not going to be humiliated
in front of the entire neighborhood.

49
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,544
And, just so you know
how serious I am...

50
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,852
- What's that?
- Santa's cell-phone number.

51
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,722
How did you get that?

52
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,627
I know someone
who knows someone who knows an elf.

53
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,665
And if any of you acts up,
so help me, I will call Santa

54
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,702
and I will tell him
you want socks for Christmas.

55
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,897
Are you willing to risk that?

56
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,639
OK. Let's get this over with.

57
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:13,750
Gabrielle Solis who lives down the block
brought a spicy paella.

58
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:18,251
Since her modeling days in New York,
Gabrielle had developed a taste

59
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,724
for rich food...

60
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,987
...and rich men.

61
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,490
Carlos, who worked in mergers
and acquisitions,

62
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,430
proposed on their third date.

63
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,834
Gabrielle was touched
when tears welled up in his eyes.

64
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:36,602
But she soon discovered this happened
every time Carlos closed a big deal.

65
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,509
Gabrielle liked her paella piping hot.

66
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:44,049
However, her relationship with
her husband was considerably cooler.

67
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,482
If you talk to Al Mason at this thing,

68
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,952
mention how much
I paid for your necklace.

69
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,115
Why not pin the receipt to my chest?

70
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,182
He let me know what he paid
for his wife's convertible.

71
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,421
- Just work it in.
- There's no way I can.

72
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,693
Why not? At the Donahue party
everyone was talking mutual funds.

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,065
You mentioned
you slept with half the Yankee outfield.

74
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,833
It came up
in the context of the conversation.

75
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,238
People are staring.
Keep your voice down.

76
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,675
Absolutely. We wouldn't want them
to think we're not happy.

77
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,270
Bre Van De Kamp, who lives next door,

78
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,248
brought baskets of muffins
she baked from scratch.

79
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:23,220
Bre was known for her cooking.
And for making her own clothes.

80
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,151
And for doing her own gardening.

81
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:30,184
And for re-upholstering
her own furniture.

82
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:34,027
Yes, Bre's many talents were known
throughout the neighborhood.

83
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,764
Everyone on Wisteria Lane thought
of Bre as the perfect wife and mother.

84
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:42,705
Everyone, that is,
except her own family.

85
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,776
Paul. Zachary.

86
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,974
- Hello, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
- You shouldn't have.

87
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:55,282
It was no trouble. The basket
with the red ribbon is for your guests.

88
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,380
The one with the blue ribbon
is just for you and Zachary.

89
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,393
It's got rolls, muffins,
breakfast type things.

90
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,689
Thank you.

91
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,595
The least I could do
was give you a decent meal

92
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,496
to look forward to in the morning.

93
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,295
I know you're
out of your minds with grief.

94
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,598
Yes, we are.

95
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,600
I will need
the baskets back once you're done.

96
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,376
Of course.

97
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,581
Susan Mayer,
who lives across the stret,

98
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,846
brought macaroni and chese.

99
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:31,115
Her husband, Karl,
always teased her about her macaroni,

100
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,627
saying it was the only thing she knew
how to cook and she rarely made it well.

101
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:39,631
It was too salty the night
she and Karl moved into their house.

102
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,958
It was too watery the night
she found lipstick on Karl's shirt.

103
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:49,507
She burned it the night Karl told her
he was leaving her for his secretary.

104
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,751
A year had passed since the divorce.

105
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,482
Susan had started to think how nice it
would be to have a man in her life.

106
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,990
Even one who would
make fun of her cooking.

107
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,221
Mom, why would
someone kill themselves?

108
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,861
Well, sometimes people are so unhappy,

109
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,992
they think that's the only way
to solve their problems.

110
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,799
- Mrs. Young always seemed happy.
- Yeah.

111
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:24,400
Sometimes people pretend to be one way,
when they're totally different inside.

112
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:29,005
Like how Dad's girlfriend always says
nice things, but we know she's a bitch.

113
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:33,142
I don't like that word, Julie.
But, yeah, that's a great example.

114
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,349
You're welcome.

115
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,523
What's going on?

116
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,927
Sorry I'm late.

117
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,732
- Hi, Susan.
- Hey.

118
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,325
So what did Karl say
when you confronted him?

119
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:20,331
You'll love this, he said, "It doesn't
mean anything. It was just sex."

120
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,367
Ah, yes, page one
of the philanderer's handbook.

121
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,599
Then he got this Zen look on his face
and said, "You know,

122
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,937
most men live lives
of quiet desperation."

123
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,170
- Tell me you punched him.
- No. I said,

124
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,237
"What do most women lead?
Lives of noisy fulfillment?"

125
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,511
- Good for you.
- Did he have to bang his secretary?

126
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,211
I had that woman to brunch.

127
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,380
An erect penis
doesn't have a conscience.

128
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,016
Even the limp ones aren't that ethical.

129
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,923
This is why I joined the NRA.

130
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,554
When Rex started going to those
conferences,

131
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,257
I wanted it in the back of his mind
that he had a wife

132
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,891
with a loaded Smith & Wesson.

133
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,233
Lynnie, Tom's always away.
Do you ever worry he might...?

134
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:03,002
He's gotten me pregnant
three times in four years.

135
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,566
I wish he was having sex
with someone else.

136
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,206
So, Susan,
is he gonna stop seeing that woman?

137
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,455
I don't know.

138
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,327
I'm sorry, you guys, I just...

139
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,954
I just don't know
how I'm gonna survive this.

140
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,161
Listen to me.

141
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,794
We all have moments of desperation.

142
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:38,771
If we can face them head-on, that's when
we find out how strong we really are.

143
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,682
Susan.

144
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:47,980
Susan.

145
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,921
I was just saying
Paul wants us to go over on Friday.

146
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,515
He needs us to help
pack up Mary Alice's things.

147
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,526
He can't face doing it by himself.

148
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,497
- Sure. That's fine.
- Are you OK?

149
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:03,433
Yeah. I'm just so angry.

150
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,734
If Mary Alice was having problems,
she should've let us help her.

151
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,707
What problems could she have had?
She was healthy,

152
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,370
had a great home, a nice family.
Her life was...

153
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,607
Our life.

154
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,679
No. If Mary Alice was having a crisis,
we'd have known.

155
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,846
She lives 50 feet away,
for God sakes.

156
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,153
Gabby, the woman killed herself.
Something must've been going on.

157
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,967
- I wouldn't eat that if I were you.
- Why?

158
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,476
I made it. Trust me.

159
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,507
Hey, hey, do you have a death wish?

160
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:54,484
No, I just don't believe that anybody
can screw up macaroni and cheese.

161
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,452
Oh, my God.

162
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:02,187
How did you...? It tastes like
it's burnt and undercooked.

163
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,526
Yeah, I get that a lot. Here you go.

164
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:12,566
Thanks. I'm Mike Delfino. I just started
renting the Sims' house next door.

165
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,334
Susan Mayer. I live across the street.

166
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:19,241
Mrs. Huber told me about you.
Said you illustrate children's books.

167
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,677
Yeah, I'm very big
with the under-five set.

168
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,510
- What do you do?

169
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:27,484
Plumber. So if you ever have a clog...

170
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,381
...or something.

171
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,454
Now that everybody's seen
that I brought something,

172
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,828
I should probably just throw this out.

173
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,875
Ease up, you little vampire.

174
00:11:56,315 --> 00:12:00,149
Lynette, I've been looking
all over for you.

175
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,687
Are you aware
of what your sons are doing?

176
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,120
Cannonball!

177
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,789
Stop!

178
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,704
What are you doing? We are at a wake.

179
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:23,434
- You said we could go in the pool.
- I said you could go by the pool.

180
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,805
Do you have your swimsuits on?

181
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,846
Yeah, we put 'em on ourselves
before we left.

182
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,281
You three planned this? All right.
That's it. Get out.

183
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,581
- No.
- No?

184
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:38,555
I am your mother.
You have to do what I say. Come on.

185
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,956
We want to swim and you can't stop us!

186
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,666
Here.

187
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,705
- No!
- Get out.

188
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:59,437
Think I won't get in this pool
and just grab you? Get out!

189
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,979
Oh!

190
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,345
Get over here.

191
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,942
All right, give me your arm.

192
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,611
You...

193
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,553
Yah!

194
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,489
That's right. Get over here.

195
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,927
Go, go, go, go, go. Move it.

196
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,369
Out. Get out.

197
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:39,714
Paul, we have to leave now.
Once again, I am so sorry for your loss.

198
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,452
Go.

199
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,923
Lynette shouldn't have ben
so concerned about my husband.

200
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:52,555
He had other things on his mind.
Things below the surface.

201
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:04,565
The morning after my funeral, my friends
and neighbors quietly went back

202
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,838
to their busy, busy lives.

203
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,414
While some did their cooking...

204
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,248
...and some did their cleaning...

205
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,648
...and some did their yoga...

206
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,349
...others...

207
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,222
...did their homework.

208
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,990
- Hi...

209
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,861
I'm Julie. I kicked my ball
into your backyard.

210
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,800
Oh, OK. Well, let's go round and get it.

211
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,338
- Stay.

212
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,501
His wife died a year ago.
In LA there were too many memories.

213
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,409
He's renting for tax purposes,
but hopes to buy soon.

214
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,539
- I can't believe you went over there.
- I saw you flirting.

215
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:47,347
Now you know he's single,
you can ask him out.

216
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,115
Julie, I like Mr. Delfino, I do.

217
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,055
I just... I don't know
if I'm ready to date yet.

218
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:57,356
You need to get back out there. How
long has it been since you've had sex?

219
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,230
- Are you mad I asked you that?
- No, I'm trying to remember.

220
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,602
I don't want to talk to you
about my love life.

221
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,970
I wouldn't have said anything. Just...

222
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,372
What?

223
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,110
I heard Dad's girlfriend ask
if you'd dated anyone since the divorce.

224
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:20,948
And Dad said he doubted it.
And then they both laughed.

225
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,265
Hey, Susan.

226
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,999
Hi, Mike. I brought you
a house-warming gift.

227
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,671
I should've brought
something by earlier.

228
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,803
- Actually, you're the first to stop by.
- Really?

229
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,871
- Susan knew she was lucky.
- Well...

230
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,782
An eligible bachelor
had moved on to Wisteria Lane

231
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,842
and she was the first to find out.

232
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,252
She also knew that good news...

233
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,688
- Hello there.
...travels quickly.

234
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:04,127
Edie Britt was the most predatory
divorcée in a five-block radius.

235
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,562
Her conquests were numerous.

236
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,465
Varied.

237
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,435
And legendary.

238
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,338
Wh... Ah!

239
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,867
Hi, Susan. I hope I'm not interrupting.

240
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:26,148
You must be Mike Delfino.
Hi, I'm Edie... Britt.

241
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,118
I live over there.

242
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,552
Welcome to Wisteria Lane.

243
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,887
Susan had met the enemy.
And she was a slut.

244
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,019
Thank you. What's this?

245
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,930
Sausage puttanesca.
It's just something I threw together.

246
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,967
Well, thanks, Edie.

247
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:48,473
That's... great. I'd invite you in,
but I was in the middle of something.

248
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,600
- I'm late for an appointment.
- I just wanted to say hi.

249
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,976
And just like that,
the race for Mike Delfino had begun.

250
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,949
For a moment, Susan
wondered if her rivalry with Edie

251
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,712
would remain friendly.

252
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:04,222
Oh, Mike, I heard you're a plumber.

253
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,120
But she was reminded that
when it came to men...

254
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,662
Could you stop by later
and take a look at my pipes?

255
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,197
...women don't fight fair.
- Sure.

256
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,957
Thanks.

257
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,403
Bye, Susan.

258
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,205
- You can't order me around.
- Gabrielle.

259
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,607
No, no. I'm not going.

260
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,773
Tanaka expects
everyone to bring their wives.

261
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,216
Every time I'm around that man,
he tries to grab my ass.

262
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,447
I made over 200,000
doing business with him last year.

263
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,548
If he wants to grab your ass, let him.

264
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,862
- John.
- Ow!

265
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,632
Mr. Solis, you scared me.

266
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,572
Why is that bush there?
You were supposed to dig it up.

267
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,940
- I didn't have time.
- I don't want excuses.

268
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,208
Just take care of it.

269
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,317
I really hate the way you talk to me.

270
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,649
And I hate that I spent $15,000
on your diamond necklace

271
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,347
you couldn't live without.

272
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:16,520
But I'm learning to deal with it. So can
I tell Tanaka we'll be there tomorrow?

273
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,588
John, we have bandages
top shelf in the kitchen.

274
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,030
Thanks, Mrs. Solis.

275
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,537
Fine, I'll go.

276
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,201
But I'm keeping my back pressed
against the wall the entire time.

277
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:37,112
See, now this is what
a marriage is all about. Compromise.

278
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,457
- Is your finger OK?
- Yeah, it's just a small cut.

279
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,687
Let me see. Mmm.

280
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:11,212
You know, Mrs. Solis,
I really like it when we hook up,

281
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,480
but, um, you know,
I got to get my work done and...

282
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:18,078
...I can't afford to lose this job.

283
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:24,093
This table was hand-carved.
Carlos had it imported from Italy.

284
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,894
It cost him $23,000.

285
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,094
You want to do it
on the table this time?

286
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,728
Absolutely.

287
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,952
Why can't we ever have normal soup?

288
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,686
Danielle, there is nothing abnormal
about basil purée.

289
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,126
Once, can we have a soup
people have heard of?

290
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,563
- Like French onion or navy bean?
- Your father can't eat onions.

291
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:06,900
He's deathly allergic. And I won't even
dignify your navy bean suggestion.

292
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,964
So, how's the osso buco?

293
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:13,169
- It's OK.
- It's OK?

294
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,473
I spent three hours cooking this meal.

295
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:20,575
How do you think it feels when you say,
"It's OK" in that sullen tone?

296
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,017
Who asked you to spend three hours
on dinner?

297
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,951
Excuse me?

298
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,724
Tim Harper's mom gets home from work,
pops open a can of pork and beans,

299
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,923
and they're eating,
everyone's happy.

300
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,401
- You'd rather I served pork and beans?
- Apologize now, I beg.

301
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:42,303
I'm saying do you always have to serve
cuisine? Can't we just have food?

302
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,399
- Are you doing drugs?
- What?

303
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,501
Change in behavior
is a warning sign

304
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,877
and you have been as fresh as paint
for the last six months.

305
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,450
It explains why you're always
in the bathroom.

306
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,781
- That is not what he's doing.
- Shut up.

307
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,616
Mom, I'm not the one
with the problem here.

308
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:01,716
You're the one acting like
she's running for Mayor of Stepford.

309
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,990
Rex... seeing that
you're the head of this household,

310
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,327
I'd appreciate you saying something.

311
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,961
Pass the salt?

312
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,407
Thre days after my funeral,

313
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:29,510
Lynette replaced her grief
with a much more useful emotion.

314
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,646
Indignation.

315
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,555
Tom, this is my fifth message
and you still haven't called me back.

316
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:39,586
You must be having a lot of fun on
your business trip. I can only imagine.

317
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,394
Guess what, the kids and I
want to have some fun too,

318
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:46,301
so unless you call me back by noon,
we're getting a plane and joining you.

319
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,431
- Mom.
- Not now. Mommy's threatening Daddy.

320
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,170
- Mom.
- No, I...

321
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:55,543
- Where are your brothers?
- Noodles, my favorite.

322
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,714
- Lynette Scavo?
- Crap.

323
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,385
Natalie Klein. I don't believe it.

324
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:14,557
- Lynette. How long has it been?
- Years. How are you? How's the firm?

325
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,864
- Good. Everyone misses you.
- Yeah.

326
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,336
We all say, if you hadn't quit
you'd be running the place by now.

327
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,874
Yeah, well.

328
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:28,641
So how's domestic life?

329
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,012
Don't you just love being a mom?

330
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:35,452
And there it was. The question
that Lynette always dreaded.

331
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,249
Well, to be honest...

332
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:41,019
For those who asked it,
only one answer was acceptable.

333
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,927
So Lynette responded
as she always did. She lied.

334
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,863
It's the best job I've ever had.

335
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,676
- You know what I don't get?
- What?

336
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,680
Why you married Mr. Solis.

337
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:12,954
Well, he promised to give me
everything I've ever wanted.

338
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:17,188
- And did he?
- Yes.

339
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,729
Then why aren't you happy?

340
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,869
Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.

341
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:29,373
So do you love him?

342
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,941
I do.

343
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:34,342
So then why are we here?
Why are we doing this?

344
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,677
Because I don't want
to wake up one morning

345
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,649
with a sudden urge
to blow my brains out.

346
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,981
- Hey, can I have a drag?
- Absolutely not.

347
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:50,653
You are much too young to smoke.

348
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:56,057
How would you feel if I used your child
support payments for plastic surgery?

349
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,604
Stop being nervous. You're just
asking him to dinner. No big deal.

350
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,366
You're right.

351
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,305
So is that your project for school?

352
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,607
In fifth grade I made
the White House out of sugar cubes.

353
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:11,307
Stop stalling and go. Before
Mike figures out he can do better.

354
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:16,217
Tell me again
why I fought for custody of you.

355
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:20,451
- You were using me to hurt Dad.
- Oh, that's right.

356
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,717
Oh, God.

357
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,866
- Hi.
- Hey, Susan.

358
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,372
- Are you busy?
- No, not at all. What's up?

359
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:42,743
Well, I... I just, uh,
was wondering if...

360
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,544
...if there was any chance
that you, uh...

361
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,486
...I just wanted to ask if...

362
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,148
- Edie.
- Hey, there, Susan.

363
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,819
- What are you...?
- I was making ambrosia.

364
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:00,661
And I made too much so I thought
I'd bring some over to Mike.

365
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,632
- What's going on?
- Susan was gonna ask me something.

366
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,571
Uh...

367
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,839
- I have a clog.
- Excuse me?

368
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,970
- And you're a plumber, right?
- Yeah.

369
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,710
- The clog's in the pipe.
- Yeah, that's usually where they are.

370
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:23,447
- Well, I've got one.
- OK. Let me get my tools.

371
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,219
Now? You want to come over now?
You have company.

372
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,691
I don't mind.

373
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,025
Just give me two minutes.
I'll be right over.

374
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,700
That's it.

375
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,708
- Stuff the hair down.
- I stuffed it.

376
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,575
- It's not enough to clog it.
- Here. Here. Look.

377
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,672
Put in this peanut butter.

378
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,445
And this cooking oil.

379
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,146
- Mom...
- And these olives.

380
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,289
- It's not working.

381
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,053
Oh, God. That's him.

382
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,925
How am I gonna stop up the sink?

383
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,865
Well, here's your problem.

384
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,239
Somebody stuffed
a bunch of Popsicle sticks down here.

385
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:23,638
I've told Julie a million times not to
play in the kitchen. Kids, you know.

386
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:33,587
I'll go put in your orders and I'll be
back with your plates for the salad bar.

387
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,819
Thank you.

388
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:38,385
Andrew, Danielle, napkins. Thank you.

389
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:44,291
They have video games. Can we go play
until our food gets here?

390
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:48,668
- This is family time. I think...
- Go ahead and play.

391
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,909
I know you think I'm angry
about coming here, but I'm not.

392
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,147
The kids wanted a change of pace,
something fun.

393
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:08,852
I get it. They'll want something
healthier tomorrow, though.

394
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,225
- I'm thinking chicken saltimbocca.
- I want a divorce.

395
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:18,293
I just can't live in this...

396
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,605
...this detergent commercial anymore.

397
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,769
The salad bar's there.
Help yourself.

398
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,108
Thank you.

399
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,545
Um, I think I'll go get
your salad for you.

400
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:50,095
- Bree Van De Kamp.
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Huber.

401
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:55,069
We didn't get a chance to talk
at Mary Alice's wake. How are you doing?

402
00:27:56,241 --> 00:28:00,439
Bre longed to share the truth
about her husband's painful betrayal.

403
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:04,777
But sadly for Bre,
admitting defeat was not an option.

404
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,717
Great. Everything is just great.

405
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:13,747
I got you the honey mustard dressing.
The ranch looked a little bit suspect.

406
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,628
Are we gonna talk about what I said?

407
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,570
If you think I'll discuss
my marriage in a place

408
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,643
with rest-rooms labeled "Chicks"
and "Dudes", you're out of your mind.

409
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,948
- What's in this?
- What do you mean? It's salad.

410
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,180
- With... with onions.
- What?

411
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,313
- You put onions in my salad.
- No I didn't.

412
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,361
Oh, wait.

413
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:03,901
The sound that awakened my son was
something he'd heard only once before.

414
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:07,536
Many years ago
when he was quite young.

415
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,346
But he recognized it instantly.

416
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:22,651
It was the sound of a family secret.

417
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:46,074
Seven days after my funeral,
life on Wisteria Lane

418
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:49,279
finally returned to normal.

419
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:53,721
Which, for some of my friends,
was unfortunate.

420
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,452
- Mommy, Mommy!
- Now what?

421
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,499
- Daddy's home!

422
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,898
Come on! Hey, is anybody home?

423
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:08,404
- Hey!
- Hey!

424
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,668
I wasn't expecting you for a week.

425
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,210
I have to go back to 'Frisco
in the morning.

426
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,508
But I got your call.
You sounded frazzled.

427
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,808
Yeah.

428
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:20,112
- It's been a little rough.
- Hi. Yeah. Peaches.

429
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,016
Did you buy us any presents?

430
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,919
Oh, God, presents.
Wait up. Let me see.

431
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,256
- Ohhh!
- Yeah!

432
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,425
But I'm not giving it to you unless you
promise to go outside right now

433
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,094
and practise throwing for 20 minutes.

434
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,694
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
- Punks. Get out!

435
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:45,675
Who's open? Go out.
Deeper. Deeper. Touchdown!

436
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,611
Oh, my God.

437
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,674
Oh, no.

438
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:58,487
You got to be kidding. I'm exhausted.
I look terrible. I'm covered in peaches.

439
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:03,823
- I'm sorry, baby. I got to have you.
- Well, is it OK if I just lie here?

440
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:06,954
- Absolutely.

441
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,297
- I love you.
- I love you more... Oh, baby.

442
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,600
Wait.
I was having trouble with swelling.

443
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,506
The doctor took me off the pill.
Put on a condom.

444
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,044
- A condom?
- Yeah.

445
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,841
What's the big deal? Let's risk it.

446
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,975
- Let's risk it?
- Yeah.

447
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,426
- I can't believe you tried to kill me.
- Yes, well, I feel badly about that.

448
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:45,060
Mrs. Huber came over and I got
distracted. It was a mistake.

449
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:48,162
- Since when do you make mistakes?
- What does that mean?

450
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:53,472
It means I'm sick of you
being so damn perfect all the time.

451
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,843
I'm sick of the bizarre way
your hair doesn't move.

452
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:01,011
I'm sick of you making our bed in the
morning before I've used the bathroom.

453
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:05,419
You're this plastic suburban housewife,
with her pearls and spatula,

454
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,823
who says things like
"We owe the Hendersons a dinner."

455
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,457
Where's the woman I fell in love with...

456
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:19,866
...who used to burn the toast
and drink milk out of the carton?

457
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,032
And laugh.

458
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:32,479
I need her. Not this cold,
perfect thing you've become.

459
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,984
These need water.

460
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:58,572
Bre sobbed quietly
in the restroom for five minutes,

461
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,735
but her husband never knew.

462
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,277
Because when Bre finally emerged...

463
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,486
...she was perfect.

464
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:20,991
- I found my earrings. We can go now.
- Was John here today?

465
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,430
Well, yeah.

466
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,267
The lawn hasn't ben mowed. I've
had it. We're getting a real gardener.

467
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,703
- Why?
- Are you deaf?

468
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,435
I just said he's not doing his job.

469
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,342
It's dark. You just can't se
the lawn has ben mowed.

470
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,506
- It hasn't. Fel this grass.
- I'm not feling the grass.

471
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,915
Let's just get going.
Come on, we're late.

472
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,016
- Take care of it.
- Yes, sir.

473
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,202
There's Tanaka.
Time for me to go and do my dance.

474
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,396
Good luck, swetheart.

475
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,971
You se that man just walked away?

476
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:12,948
Can you make sure he has a drink
in his hand all night long?

477
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,080
Yes, ma'am.

478
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,558
Mm.

479
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:54,674
- Susan? Susan!
- Mrs. Huber, how are you doing?

480
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:58,916
Not too well, I'm afraid. I'm trying to
find something to soothe my stomach.

481
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,322
- It's upset?
- Yeah.

482
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:05,691
I had the worst macaroni and chese at
the wake. It's ben running through me.

483
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,891
And I ned to be at my best. Edie
Britt's son is spending the night.

484
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,396
He's spending the night?

485
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,598
Edie is having a gentleman friend
over for dinner,

486
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,971
and I think she plans on
entertaining into the we hours,

487
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,135
if you know what I mean.

488
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,805
Oh, here's some antacid.
Have you ever tried this?

489
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,753
I can't believe it.
This can't be happening.

490
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,118
Mike can't like Edie
better than me.

491
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,627
You don't know what's going on.
Maybe they're just having dinner.

492
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,321
You're right. They're doing it.

493
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,907
Edie?

494
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,580
Edie?

495
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:16,725
Hello? Anybody home?

496
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,597
I ned to borrow sugar.

497
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:43,020
Oh, my God!
Oh, yes! Give it to me!

498
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,996
And just like that,
the possibility Susan had clung to,

499
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:52,593
the maybe of Mike Delfino,
was gone forever.

500
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,867
And despite the precariousness
of her situation,

501
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,034
Susan took a moment to mourn her loss.

502
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:16,124
Oh.

503
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,729
Oh! Oh!

504
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:31,199
It didn't take Susan long to realize,
this was just not her night.

505
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,070
Is somebody out there?

506
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,376
- Oh, my God! That's smoke!

507
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,229
Oh, my God.

508
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,128
She left candles unattended in the den.

509
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,194
Paramedic said she was lucky.
She could've ben killed.

510
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,374
 She ran out with nothing on.

511
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:08,973
- She was having sex with some guy.
- What happened to him?

512
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,776
He got smoke inhalation.
He's at the hospital.

513
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,441
Oh.

514
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,077
Susan, are you all right?
You look awful.

515
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:22,717
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I just, uh, fel really bad for Edie.

516
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,796
Oh, honey, don't worry about Edie.
She's a strong lady.

517
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:30,061
Absolutely. She'll get through this.
She'll find a way to survive.

518
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,397
We all do.

519
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,803
Come on.

520
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,353
- Wow! What happened?
- Mike!

521
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:01,830
And suddenly there he was.
Like a phoenix rising from the ashes.

522
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:06,199
I... I thought you were... uh...
Where were you?

523
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:09,830
I just got back from the movies.
Edie had a fire, huh?

524
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:16,813
Yeah. Yeah, but she's fine now.
Everything's fine now.

525
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,850
And just like that, Susan was happy.

526
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,614
Life was suddenly full of...
possibilities.

527
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,696
Not to mention
a few unexpected surprises.

528
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,060
- Hello.
- It's me.

529
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,264
- Have anything yet?
- No, nothing yet.

530
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:46,434
But don't worry.
I'm definitely getting closer.

531
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:58,586
I brought some champagne.
I thought we should have a toast.

532
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:02,489
The next day my friends came together
to pack away my clothes,

533
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,088
my personal belongings
and what was left of my life.

534
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,792
All right, ladies, lift 'em up.

535
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:13,995
To Mary Alice,
a good friend and neighbor.

536
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,596
Wherever you are,
we hope you've found peace.

537
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,268
- To Mary Alice.
- To Mary Alice.

538
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,917
Let's get this show on the road.

539
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,476
You guys,
check out Mary Alice's clothes.

540
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:34,456
Size eight? Ha!
She always told me she was a size six.

541
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:39,086
- We found the skeleton in her closet.
- Not quite, Gabrielle, not quite.

542
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:41,960
- What's that?
- A letter addressed to Mary Alice.

543
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,098
How ironic.

544
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:48,502
To have something I tried so desperately
to kep secret, treated so casually.

545
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:52,269
- What are you doing? That's private.
- It's open. What's the big deal?

546
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:07,516
- What does this mean?
- Don't know. Check out the postmark.

547
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:10,355
Oh, my God. She got it the day she died.

548
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,658
Do you think this is why she...?

549
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:19,299
I'm so sorry, girls. I never wanted you
to be burdened with this.

550
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,804
Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?
