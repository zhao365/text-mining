1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:03,867
Desperate Housewives S01E03 Pretty Little Picture (VO+STFR&EN)

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:08,271
She was his wife.
He deserves to have all the facts.

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:12,209
She abandoned her husband
and her son and I'll never forgive her.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,670
It's the age-old question.

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,911
How much do we want to know
about our neighbors?

6
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:20,680
Cancel the meeting
with the divorce lawyer.

7
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,881
We'll find a marriage counselor.

8
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:26,050
- I'm Mike Delfino.
- Susan Mayer. I live across the street.

9
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,823
- You're gonna have to ask him out.
- I keep hoping he'll ask me out.

10
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,830
I really hate the way you talk to me.

11
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:35,061
I hate that I spent $15,000
on your diamond necklace,

12
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,864
but I'm learning to deal with it.

13
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,200
- Do you love him?
- I do.

14
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,173
So then why are we here?
Why are we doing this?

15
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,267
I don't want to wake up
one morning,

16
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:47,438
with a sudden urge
to blow my brains out.

17
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,084
After I died,

18
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:57,886
I began to surrender the parts of myself
that were no longer necessary.

19
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,791
My desires, beliefs, ambitions, doubts.

20
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,957
Every trace of my humanity
was discarded.

21
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:09,259
I discovered,
when moving through eternity,

22
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,599
it helps to travel lightly.

23
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,406
In fact, I held on to only one thing.

24
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,103
My memory.

25
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,347
It's astonishing to look back
on the world I left behind.

26
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:27,614
I remember it all. Every single detail.

27
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,191
Like my friend, Bre Van De Kamp.

28
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,427
I remember the easy confidence
of her smile.

29
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:42,726
The gentle elegance of her hands.

30
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,537
The refined warmth of her voice.

31
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,436
Bye.

32
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,412
- But what I remember most about Bre...
- Rex, wasn't that a lovely...

33
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,814
...was the look of fear in her eyes.

34
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:02,052
Bre had started to realize
her world was unraveling.

35
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,091
And for a woman
who despised loose ends,

36
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,127
that was unacceptable.

37
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:13,555
- Rex, Rex, you need to get up.
- It's not even light out.

38
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,433
If the kids see you sleeping down here,
they'll start asking questions.

39
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:22,134
- Let 'em ask. I don't care anymore.
- Well, I care.

40
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,473
They don't need to be burdened
with our marital problems.

41
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:28,013
The least we can do
is keep up appearances.

42
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,606
Oh, yeah, appearances.

43
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,481
I keep forgetting about appearances.

44
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,885
Rex, you look so tired.

45
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:41,154
I didn't sleep.
This damn thing is so uncomfortable.

46
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:44,628
Why don't you move back upstairs
and sleep in our bed?

47
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,860
We're in marriage counseling.
That would confuse things.

48
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,131
It's just... I miss you.

49
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,138
I know you do.

50
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,032
If I don't start getting
some sleep soon,

51
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,273
I'll be forced back upstairs
out of sheer exhaustion.

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,180
Yes, Bre was afraid of many things.

53
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,419
But if there was one thing
she wasn't afraid of...

54
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,396
...it was a challenge.

55
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,810
The day on Wisteria Lane
began like any other

56
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:12,282
with a cup of coffe
and the morning paper,

57
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,048
and while Lynette read
the business section,

58
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,988
and Gabrielle studied
the fall collections,

59
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:21,322
and Bre searched for decorating ideas,

60
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:27,663
Susan scanned the front page
and saw something that caught her eye.

61
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,921
- It's about time.
- Be nice. I come bearing snacks.

62
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,462
Lynette, these cards are sticky.

63
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,159
I know. Preston used the three
of diamonds to scoop jam out of a jar.

64
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,998
We're just thankful we have
49 cards to play with.

65
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,470
- Hello, sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

66
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,099
I was just saying
I want to throw a dinner party.

67
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,506
- Really?
- Yes.

68
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,477
I mean, we've never done
a big group thing.

69
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,070
It's a great idea.

70
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,242
Paul never likes to have people over,
but to heck with him.

71
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,776
- So when is this shindig?
- How about a month from tonight?

72
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,254
- The 16th. Good for everyone?
- Works for me.

73
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,782
- Shall we all make something?
- Oh, no. This is my party.

74
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,263
I've been wanting to have everyone over
for years. I'm so happy we're doing it.

75
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,630
It's gonna be so much fun.

76
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,760
Hey!

77
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,270
I know. Her dinner.

78
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,807
How could we have all
forgotten about this?

79
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:45,742
We didn't forget. Usually when
the hostess dies, the party's off.

80
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,541
- Lynette!
- I'm not being flip.

81
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,342
Just pointing out a reality.

82
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:53,078
Mary Alice was so excited
about it. It's so sad.

83
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:57,612
- I think we should go through with it.
- Wouldn't that be in poor taste?

84
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:01,216
No. It's a way to honor Mary Alice.
It was so important to her.

85
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,989
We could all use a fun night.

86
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:07,158
Good. I have some new flat bread
I've been dying to show off.

87
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,030
- Lynette?
- I'm in.

88
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,570
- I'll make braised lamb shanks.
- I'm still in.

89
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,000
How many will I be cooking for?

90
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,167
Seven. Three couples and Susan.
Does that sound right?

91
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:21,839
- No, it sounds very, very wrong.
- Is there someone you'd like to invite?

92
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,622
I have an idea.

93
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:41,932
A dinner party? I may be working late.
The Dillman proposal's a complete mess.

94
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,435
You promised to be home
every night this week.

95
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,837
I'll try, but I can't guarantee
anything. This is business.

96
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,569
Says the prince
as he rides off into the sunset.

97
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,009
Boy, did the movies ever get that wrong.

98
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,411
You know your problem?
You're very tense.

99
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:59,008
You should go to a spa or go shopping.
Find a way to relax.

100
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,263
- Hello.
- Where are you?

101
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,030
- Algebra.
- Are you free at four?

102
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,232
I'm not sure.
I've got track after school.

103
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:26,040
Get here as fast as you can.
My husband says I need to relax.

104
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,979
You want me to keep
my gym clothes on like last time?

105
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,312
If you would, please.

106
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,977
- A dinner party?
- Yeah. It'll be fun.

107
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:38,080
- Bree's cooking. Everyone's going.
- I haven't even unpacked yet.

108
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,615
I just, uh, I just need
to chill out for the next few days.

109
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,254
Oh, Tom.

110
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,594
There'll be liquor,
and hors d'oeuvres,

111
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,602
and grown-ups without children,
and silverware.

112
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,197
- Remember silverware?
- Honey, can you take this in for me?

113
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,640
- Have you heard anything I said?
- I'm sorry, I'm wiped out.

114
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,306
3 cities in 6 days. My head is pounding.
I'm not ready for a dinner party.

115
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,373
- I already got a sitter.
- Can't you cancel her?

116
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,454
Please. Let's just stay in
tomorrow night.

117
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,456
We can get a bottle of wine
and rent a video.

118
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:15,221
I just want to hang out
with my best gal, that's all.

119
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,562
I was looking so forward
to a night out.

120
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:23,898
I know, sweetie,
I'm sorry, but I... I'm beat.

121
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,464
I mean, do you remember what
it was like to work a 60-hour week?

122
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,873
A dinner party? Do I have to go?

123
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:40,879
Given that we're hosting it, I'd say so.
By the way, you won't be drinking.

124
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,420
Why's that?

125
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,718
Because when you drink, you get chatty.

126
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,122
No one need know
we're seeing Dr. Goldfine.

127
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:51,095
If you spent as much time working
on our problems as covering them...

128
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,289
Not a drop.

129
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,358
This is ridiculous.
And us taking tennis lessons?

130
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:00,394
Your office may wonder
why you disappear three times a week.

131
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,203
Tennis lessons are a plausible alibi.

132
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,535
So, these tennis lessons.
How are we doing?

133
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:12,380
My backhand's improving, but
you're having problems with your serve.

134
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,080
Of course.

135
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:16,812
A dinner party?

136
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,983
It's tomorrow night,
so keep Julie an extra day.

137
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,517
Fine. But that's all. Brandi and I
leave Sunday for the cabin.

138
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,029
What cabin?

139
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,861
Brandi wanted someplace
we could get away.

140
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:31,267
Escrow just closed yesterday.

141
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,170
You can afford a cabin,
but not child support?

142
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,609
- The check is in the mail.
- No, it's not.

143
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,406
I found my dental guard. I'm ready.

144
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,410
Stop fighting.

145
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,884
We're being as nice
as we possibly can.

146
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,047
Like I said, stop fighting.

147
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:04,061
Excuse me, Brandi, do you mind?

148
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,401
- Oh, okay.
- Wait. Susan, you're right there.

149
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:15,208
- You could pick it up.
- I could, but she threw it.

150
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:20,076
- Don't be petulant. Pick up the can.
- No.

151
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,781
- I can pick it up.
- Honey, stay out of this.

152
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:31,528
Fine. This is so typical.

153
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:37,993
- I'm sorry. Was that petulant too?
- Pick up the damn can yourself.

154
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,834
Yeah, well, you just go to hell.

155
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,902
You want me to pick it up?

156
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,239
Uh...

157
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,683
Mrs. Warmington said she looked for
Mom's obituary and couldn't find it.

158
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:06,198
- Did you put one in?
- I've had other things on my mind.

159
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,968
How could you not do that?
People will think we didn't care.

160
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:16,099
I doubt people will give it much
thought. Don't worry about it.

161
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,473
You never talk about her.

162
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:22,105
She's been dead a month and it's
like you've forgotten she existed.

163
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,275
It's a little early
for this kind of talk.

164
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:30,884
Maybe when you die,
I won't put in an obituary.

165
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,384
That will be your choice to make.

166
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,997
Assuming you outlive me.

167
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:49,899
Mom, it's no big deal. We're driving
in for the baptism. Problem solved.

168
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,968
- OK. Fine. You go with Aunt Maria,

169
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,140
and I will take Nana to church.

170
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,343
Take your clothes off.

171
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,251
Uh-huh. OK, I got to go, Mom.

172
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,221
Yes, right now.

173
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,918
OK. You can give me
directions later. Bye.

174
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,760
- Hi, how was school?
- Got an A-minus in my biology exam.

175
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,926
You did? Mmm. Well,
let's see what you've learned.

176
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,137
- Who's that?

177
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,901
I don't know.

178
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,998
Hey, you!

179
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:29,974
Oh.

180
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,746
So, did Mike say anything?

181
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,583
No, but, God, you should've seen
the look on his face.

182
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,881
I'm sure it's not that bad.
He's coming to the party, right?

183
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,327
I left three messages.
He's not going to come. Big surprise.

184
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,526
I did everything but foam at the mouth.
I hate when I get that way.

185
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,537
Every time I get within ten feet
of Karl, I just become this monster.

186
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,403
It's not gonna change
until you resolve your issues.

187
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,601
- You mean, forgive him?
- Mm.

188
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,112
I've lived with this bitterness so long,
I'd be Ionely without it.

189
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,014
Honey, get a pet. See ya.

190
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,647
- Son of a...
- It's a business meeting.

191
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,350
It's a frat party.

192
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,291
Regional manager,
corporate manager, head of sales.

193
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,158
Margarita, cigar, sombrero.

194
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:21,996
Ah, honey, what do you want me to do?
Sit around the hotel watching cable?

195
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,559
No, but when I say
we've been invited to a party,

196
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,971
don't whine about
your exhausting 60-hour week.

197
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:33,501
Put on your dancing shoes and take your
children's mother out for a good time.

198
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,140
Fine. You're right.
Let's go to that party.

199
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:41,050
- I already cancelled the sitter.
- OK. We'll throw the next one.

200
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,216
Throw a dinner party?
I don't even have time to wash my face.

201
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,425
No. You know what?
I'm gonna go to this one.

202
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,465
You can stay home and baby sit.

203
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:57,195
Fine. I can handle that.

204
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,182
Thank you.

205
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:18,554
Gabrielle spent her morning searching
for the mysterious little girl.

206
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,615
Sadly for her...

207
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,661
...the mystery was solved
a bit too quickly.

208
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,028
Hey. What's going on?

209
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,470
Have you met Ashley?

210
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,037
Found it.

211
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,705
This is Sheila Bukowski. They moved
into the Miller's old house.

212
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,749
My daughter left her ball
in your yard. I'm so sorry.

213
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:49,117
Oh. Oh, no, no problem.
Nice to meet you, Ashley.

214
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,224
She's shy. She doesn't say much.

215
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,625
Yeah, but I can see
her little mind working away.

216
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,054
Nice meeting you.

217
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,802
Come on, Ashley.

218
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:46,543
Private sessions?
Why do we need private sessions?

219
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,810
Private sessions allow us to work on
the personal issues of both partners.

220
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,350
I don't have any.

221
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,852
My only issue is that
my husband wants to leave.

222
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,047
How can I work on that
if he's not there?

223
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:02,082
There are things I need to discuss with
Dr. Goldfine and I can't have you there.

224
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:06,530
Why? I'm your wife.
You can say anything in front of me.

225
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,532
All we need is a few more sessions...

226
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,003
Damn it, Bree, a few more sessions
isn't gonna fix us.

227
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:16,303
This is bigger than that.

228
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,570
Why don't we do it this way?

229
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:23,604
Rex, you can take the first half-hour.
Bree, you can take the second.

230
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,408
Fine.

231
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,320
Oh, and doctor, if what he's about to
discuss has anything to do with

232
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,257
adultery, prostitution
or internet pornography,

233
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,386
I would really appreciate you
taking a moral hard line.

234
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:56,073
Hi, Ashley, remember me?

235
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,139
We... we met earlier.

236
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,577
Wow! Aren't you the little artist.

237
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,316
What are those? Flamingos?

238
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,052
No.

239
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:14,831
Well, they're very pretty.
It almost looks like they're kissing.

240
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,893
Funny thing about kissing.
It's not just for husbands and wives.

241
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,372
Sometimes we kiss our mom,
or our grandpa,

242
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,033
sometimes we even kiss our dog.

243
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,746
Sometimes we even kiss people
who are just our friends.

244
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,545
Kind of like a high five
on the lips, right?

245
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,450
Ah... Hey, Ash!

246
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:43,052
I was at the mall and I saw this.
Thought you might like it.

247
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:47,360
She's Hawaiian.
Her name is Princess Kaha'lua.

248
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:51,870
And I think it means "little waterfall"
or "big pond" or something.

249
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,071
OK. So we're good, right?

250
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:05,211
OK. Well, you enjoy
your new little friend,

251
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,720
and if there's anything else
you need, you just let me know.

252
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,691
What I'd really like is a bike.

253
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:47,390
- Where did you find that?
- She used this to kill herself.

254
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,122
Why would you keep it? Why?

255
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,666
- I thought we might need it someday.
- For what?

256
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,760
- Protection.
- I want to talk about mom.

257
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,273
- Take your medication.
- We're going to talk about mom.

258
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,953
Hello, Zach,
I hope this isn't a bad time.

259
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,158
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Van De Kamp?

260
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:26,186
I wanted to invite you and your
father to a dinner party tomorrow night.

261
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,233
I'm not sure where he is right now.

262
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,633
Oh, well, I'm sorry
it's such late notice,

263
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:37,801
but we weren't sure that you were ready
for any kind of social engagement.

264
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,777
We're sort of throwing it
in your mother's honor.

265
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,709
Really?

266
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,649
Yes, it's just going to be
a casual night with the gang.

267
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:51,052
We're going to eat and tell fun stories
about your mom.

268
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,926
Zach... are you OK?

269
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,296
- Hello, Bree.
- Oh, hi, Paul. I was just...

270
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,961
I heard. Thank you.
But we already have plans for tomorrow.

271
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,870
Oh... That's too bad.

272
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,706
Well, I should go.

273
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,612
- Thank you, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
- For what, Zach?

274
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,253
Remembering my mom.

275
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,782
Hmm.

276
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:33,258
That night, Paul gave his son
something to calm his nerves.

277
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,768
And the next day,
Gabrielle calmed her own nerves,

278
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,066
by giving something
to her new best friend.

279
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:44,734
Here you go. Top of the line,
three-speed, aluminum frame,

280
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,937
handle-bar ribbons and a bell.

281
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,810
And it's royal blue
to match your pretty little eyes.

282
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,543
My eyes are green.

283
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:56,179
Well, you'll be cruising so fast
on this, no one will even notice.

284
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,723
It's all yours, honey. Have fun.

285
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,155
- What? What's wrong?
- I don't know how to ride a bike.

286
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:12,169
What? Then why did you ask for one?

287
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,501
Why can't you show me?

288
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:18,873
Well... sure. One of these days.

289
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,909
What's wrong with now?

290
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,455
After her talk with Lynette,

291
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,685
Susan decided to take a look
at her old photo album.

292
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,758
And she began to se herself
in a whole new light.

293
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,992
And the picture wasn't flattering.

294
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:56,106
Yeah, you got Karl.
Leave a message.

295
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,412
Hey, Karl, it's me.
I was hoping you'd be there.

296
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,452
Um, listen. We need to talk.

297
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,921
So maybe when
you drop Julie off tomorrow,

298
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,427
we could have a moment.
It's important.

299
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,897
Give my best to... Brandi.

300
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,034
Call me.

301
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:25,904
Susan was proud of herself. She was
finally ready to let go of her anger.

302
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,313
Well... almost.

303
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,285
- Mom!
- The boys will be hungry at 5:30.

304
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,225
So put the fish sticks
in the toaster oven at five.

305
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,559
For half an hour. I know,
that's the third time you've told me.

306
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,621
If the food's late, God help you.

307
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,862
Beautiful, I don't need a pamphlet.
It's not brain surgery.

308
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,234
They're just kids, for God's sake.

309
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,968
Preston, would you come here?

310
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,305
Yeah.

311
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,778
Sweetie, you know our rule
about eating cookies, right?

312
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,908
We can't have 'em after five
'cause sugar makes us hyper.

313
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:10,114
Yeah. But tonight, anything goes.

314
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,025
- Share with your brothers.
- Thanks, Mom.

315
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,398
Don't look at your feet.
Look at the road.

316
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:26,198
Look at the road.
Good. Uh, OK, find your balance.

317
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:30,731
Find your balance. OK. It's all you.
It's all you. You're doing great!

318
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,140
OK, stay to the right.
Watch the car. Watch the car!

319
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,547
- Uh... ah!
- Oh, God!

320
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,918
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, let's go again.

321
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,457
These heels don't have
another block in them.

322
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,254
What about tomorrow?

323
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:52,422
Well, you won't be around
tomorrow 'cause you have school.

324
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,398
I'm home schooled. I'm always around.

325
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,561
It was in that moment
that Gabrielle realized,

326
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:02,038
this ride was far from over.

327
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,776
I'm coming.

328
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,610
Why are you here?
I asked you to come tomorrow.

329
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,914
You wanted to talk.
It sounded important.

330
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:18,945
- Tomorrow. I'm in a towel.
- We were married 14 years.

331
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,458
I know what's under there. Come on.

332
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:28,995
I'm not really ready for this. I was
going to have a whole speech prepared.

333
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:32,332
Brandi and I have plans tomorrow.
I suggest you wing it.

334
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:39,968
Oh... Um... OK.

335
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:46,176
Here's the thing. I was thinking about
what happened in the driveway yesterday.

336
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:51,052
And... I just don't want to...
I don't want to live like that.

337
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,750
I don't want to be that kind of person.

338
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,989
I just thought, if the two of us...
You know, if we had a nice, calm...

339
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:02,329
- I need an apology, Karl.
- A what?

340
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,838
An apology. For the way you ended our
marriage. You never took responsibility.

341
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:13,435
I don't know what to say, Susan.
The heart wants what it wants.

342
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:17,175
- What does that mean?
- I fell in love.

343
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,412
While you were married
to someone else.

344
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:23,716
The heart wants what it wants.

345
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,519
Yeah, well, my heart wants
to hurt you, but I can control myself.

346
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:30,186
I don't want to go back
to that ugly place,

347
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:34,323
and if you do,
I suggest you get some help.

348
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,860
You know what, I don't need an apology.
I don't need anything from you.

349
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:45,137
- You're humiliating yourself.
- You're the one who's been humiliated.

350
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,977
You walked out on your family.
People think you're scum, not me.

351
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,881
So worry about yourself. I'm OK with me.

352
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,682
I can walk down the street
and hold my head high.

353
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,753
As the sun slowly settled
on Wisteria Lane,

354
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:37,056
an unsettled Susan racked her brain
to find a way into her own house.

355
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,528
Aghh!

356
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,392
Lying naked in her shrubs,
it occurred to Susan

357
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,837
this could be the most humiliating
moment of her life.

358
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,439
- Susan?
- She was wrong.

359
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:32,313
- What you doing?
- Locked myself out. Naked.

360
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,410
- Oh.
- And then I fell.

361
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,047
- So how are you?
- Good. Good.

362
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:43,186
I just got back. I've been gone all day
and I got your messages about dinner.

363
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,923
I'd love to come,
if the invite still stands.

364
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:51,867
- It's a date.
- Right. I assume the dress is casual.

365
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,769
Yeah. It's casual.

366
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:07,708
Thanks for helping me break in. Will it
be hard to replace that screen?

367
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:12,086
That depends. If you nail it in
yourself, you might want to wear gloves.

368
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:16,020
Or pants. Pants wouldn't hurt.

369
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:20,360
OK. I know what just happened
is funny in theory,

370
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:25,335
but I'm nowhere near ready to laugh
about it, so, please, no jokes.

371
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,564
Hey, where have you two been?

372
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:31,131
Susan had a problem
finding something to wear.

373
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,201
- Was that what you meant?
- Pretty much.

374
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,339
The kids are bouncing
off the walls? Huh.

375
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:40,441
I'm sure you can figure a way
to put them to bed.

376
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:43,510
For God sakes,
Tom, they're just kids.

377
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,022
Hey, are you OK?

378
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:53,030
Yes, I went jogging today
and I think I pushed myself too hard.

379
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,589
You're probably not wearing
the right shoes.

380
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,966
Yeah, that thought did cross my mind.

381
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,498
Gabrielle says you're taking
lessons three times a week.

382
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,839
I'm thinking about playing again.
It's such great exercise.

383
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,676
- That it is.
- My drop shot needs a tune up.

384
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,909
Could you give me
the number of your pro?

385
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:15,679
- Yeah. I'll give it to you later.
- What club does he work out of?

386
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:23,322
Um... We're not really
taking tennis lessons, Carlos.

387
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,328
You're not?

388
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,367
It's a story Bree concocted to cover the
fact we're seeing a marriage counselor.

389
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:37,666
Bree... Bree... He wouldn't
stop asking about the tennis pro.

390
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,476
Bree and I are in marriage counseling.

391
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,311
Everyone knows now.

392
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:51,549
Did the sky fall?
Has your life come crashing down?

393
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:01,793
If everybody would please
take your seats, dinner is served.

394
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,785
A grisly discovery
was made today

395
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,021
when a chest was found
in Rockwater Lake

396
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:34,997
by a local businessman and
his grandson while they were fishing.

397
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,626
Investigators recovered a wooden chest

398
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:41,263
containing what appear
to be human remains.

399
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,500
A police spokesman says
the body was...

400
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:27,646
OK, I got to break the ice here.
You're in counseling? Big deal.

401
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,745
You want humiliation,
I'll give you humiliation.

402
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:35,191
I locked myself out of my house
stark naked and got caught by Mike.

403
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,889
- Oh, my God. When did this happen?
- Today. Right before the party.

404
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,523
What can I say?
Right place, right time.

405
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:46,394
I can top that. Getting thrown
out of Disneyland for lewd behavior.

406
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:47,699
When was this?

407
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:51,731
When we were first married, things got
out of hand on Mr. Toad's wild ride.

408
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,003
You're kidding?

409
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,511
No. We got perp-walked
down Main Street USA.

410
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:01,951
Since we're doing true confessions,
we once broke a water bed in Cancun.

411
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,648
- How?
- He had a thing for spiked heels.

412
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:09,250
I'd like to make it clear,
she was wearing them.

413
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:15,631
Rex cries after he ejaculates.

414
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:48,328
- Think we left too early?
- I was thinking we left too late.

415
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,593
So is Rex gone for good?

416
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,504
I don't know. God, I hope not.

417
00:32:56,574 --> 00:33:01,034
They've always been wound tight,
but I've never seen 'em like that.

418
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,511
Who am I to judge?

419
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:06,174
People who live in glass houses
shouldn't throw soda cans?

420
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,913
OK, you have got to know that
I only get that angry around Karl.

421
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:14,789
He treated me so badly at the end,
I haven't been able to get past it.

422
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,317
- Maybe he did you a big favor.
- What do you mean?

423
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,695
Look at Karl as
a starter marriage, boot camp,

424
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,234
preparing you for
something better next time.

425
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:30,798
Listen, Mike, about the whole
seeing me naked thing,

426
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:37,474
I... I just want to thank you
for being such a perfect gentleman.

427
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:40,574
I wasn't a perfect gentlemen.
I might have snuck a peek.

428
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:41,675
Oh.

429
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,785
Good night!

430
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,849
And, uh, for what it's worth... wow!

431
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,333
- Hi.

432
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:10,848
- How was your night?
- We are raising little terrorists.

433
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:15,011
- You know that, don't you?
- Didn't have a good time?

434
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:19,182
OK, you know, drop the act.
I know you gave them cookies.

435
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:22,590
Doh! Who cracked anyway?

436
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,423
- Porter.
- Oh.

437
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:27,555
Yeah.
So how was your dinner party?

438
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,567
There was dinner,
but it wasn't much of a party.

439
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,297
- Uh-oh, what happened?
- I don't know.

440
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:36,499
Rex announced that
he and Bree are in counseling.

441
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:40,840
She retaliated with this whole
revelation which I won't go into,

442
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,244
and the bottom line is,
he stormed out.

443
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,646
Clearly, there's trouble in paradise.

444
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:49,117
- Honestly, I'm not that surprised.
- Why not?

445
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:52,554
I just never got the idea
that they were really happy.

446
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,995
Are we happy?

447
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:16,910
Man, oh, man. I keep seeing that look
on Rex's face. Then him taking off.

448
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:19,006
Some night.

449
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:23,816
Then again, I'd probably cry too
if I had to have sex with that woman.

450
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,857
You watch a man
get torn down like that,

451
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,222
you wonder why
he let her get away with it.

452
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:33,024
Believe me, if a woman ever
humiliated me like that in public...

453
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:36,032
Hm, it would only happen once.

454
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:48,468
- So where are you going?
- I'll be staying at the motor lodge.

455
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:52,812
The hotel by the interstate has better
rates and it's closer to your work.

456
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,614
Fine.

457
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:58,177
I'm packing your swimsuit.

458
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:01,384
There's a pool there
and I know how swimming relaxes you.

459
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,428
When our kids ask where I am,
what are you gonna say?

460
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,958
Um... I could tell them
that you went to tennis camp.

461
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:14,131
- That was a joke.
- Yeah. I got it.

462
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,370
Ah, there.

463
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:23,607
Obviously, if you've forgotten anything
you can come right back and get it.

464
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,740
Well, I'll call you.

465
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,819
Rex.

466
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:36,149
In college, when we first started
dating, people were so jealous of us.

467
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:40,789
We were the golden couple. Everybody
knew we'd have this wonderful life.

468
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,096
Why is this happening?

469
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:50,667
Because you can't even
let me pack my own suitcase.

470
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,469
All right. See ya. Have fun.

471
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,971
- Hey. Where are you going?
- Just a sec.

472
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,008
- Mom?
- Don't worry I'm not packing heat.

473
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,705
Hey, Brandi, could you scoot a little?

474
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,839
Just scoot. Thank you. Hi.

475
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,816
- What are you doing?
- I'll be quick.

476
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,614
Brandi, I'm sorry
for the way I treated you.

477
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:40,179
It was uncalled for and childish,
and it won't happen again.

478
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,386
I have built up
a lot of anger towards you, both of you.

479
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,658
And I realize now
I can't carry that around anymore.

480
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:51,828
So apology or no apology, I'm moving on.

481
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:02,178
- Mrs. Mayer.
- Brandi. Brandi, get in the car.

482
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:06,114
- Mrs. Mayer.
- Please, call me Susan.

483
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:11,785
I just wanted you to know,
what happened between me and Karl,

484
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:16,555
things got out of hand because
I thought your marriage was over.

485
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,028
Anyway, I just wanted you to know
I'm sorry, I really am.

486
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,594
Thank you.

487
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,002
And though it came from
an unexpected source,

488
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:35,512
Susan finally got the apology
she'd always wanted.

489
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:44,582
Hey, let me take those.

490
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:51,894
- You're wearing a really big hat.
- Yes, I am.

491
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,089
Listen, the kids are watching a video

492
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:59,000
which means we've got only about 45
minutes until they actually find Nemo,

493
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,801
so I suggest
that we make the most of it.

494
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,171
By reliving your night out
with the guys?

495
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:11,378
Lynette... I'm trying.

496
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:21,656
You look ridiculous in that thing.

497
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,785
Sexy ridiculous?

498
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,657
- Maybe.

499
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:32,396
I can live with "maybe."

500
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,166
Oh.

501
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:46,706
You know, it's gonna take
more than just this one night.

502
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,411
- I know.
- Hm.

503
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,420
Ah...

504
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,428
...it looks like we have an audience.

505
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:04,962
Let 'em look. As long as
they don't try and cut in.

506
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:19,077
- Dr. Goldfine.
- Bree. We're not scheduled now, are we?

507
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,950
I didn't have time to make an
appointment. Rex moved out today.

508
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,821
I'm very sorry to hear that, but
I'm completely booked right now.

509
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:32,329
I don't need much time. You have more
insight into my situation than I do...

510
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,489
Bree, we can't talk now.

511
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:37,864
If you tell me what he told you,
then I could fix the problem.

512
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:41,996
- I can't do that. It's unethical.
- Why can't you...?

513
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:45,007
That's my next appointment.
You really need to go.

514
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,168
Dr. Goldfine, please.

515
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,946
Hold on, I'll go and talk to my client.

516
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:22,603
Bre searched for Rex's
audio tape hoping to find answers.

517
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,205
She found answers all right,

518
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,740
but to entirely different questions.

519
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,812
OK. Yeah,
I'll be out in just a moment.

520
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,556
Bree, I'm sorry, he can't wait.

521
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:44,260
But I can see you first thing
in the morning, eight o'clock.

522
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,826
Eight o'clock.

523
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,338
Sorry to interrupt. Bye.

524
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,919
Yes, I remember the world, every detail.

525
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,487
And what I remember most
is how afraid I was.

526
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,856
- What a waste.

527
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:13,226
You se, to live in fear
is not to live at all.

528
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,467
I wish I could tell this
to those I left behind.

529
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,370
But would it do any good?

530
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,771
Probably not.

531
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:31,909
I understand now. There will always
be those who face their fears.

532
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:38,951
And there will always
be those... who run away.
